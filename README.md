# Afya On The Go

Welcome to **Afya On The Go**, a digital healthcare platform that connects patients with professional home-based care providers through a seamless, user-friendly web application.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About the Platform

**Afya On The Go** provides tailor-made healthcare services, enabling patients to access professional care from the comfort of their homes. The platform allows:

- **Nurses and Healthcare Practitioners**: To onboard by submitting necessary documentation for verification. Upon approval, they can create profiles and offer services.
- **Patients/Clients**: To register, upload medical records, and connect with qualified healthcare professionals.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The app will reload if you make edits and display any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production in the `build` folder. React is bundled and optimized for performance.
